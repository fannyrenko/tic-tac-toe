## Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Python (Pygame)

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using the Pygame library. Players take turns marking "X" or "O" on a 3x3 grid, and the game automatically checks for wins, draws, and restarts after a victory or draw.

  - Player vs Player: Players alternate turns as 'X' and 'O'.
  - Win Detection: The game checks for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal wins.s
  - Draw Detection: If the grid is filled without a winner, a draw is declared.
  - Automatic Reset: The game automatically resets after a player wins or if there's a draw, with a 10-second delay before the reset.
  - Interactive Interface: Players can click to place their marks on the grid.

**How to Play:**

  - Run the Python script.
  - Click on any of the empty squares on the 3x3 grid to place your mark.
  - The game will notify you of the winner or if there's a draw.
  - After a winner or draw, the game will automatically reset after 10 seconds.
